# FIFA World Cup 2022 Winner Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts FIFA World Cup 2022 match winners using historical match data, player ratings, FIFA rankings, and advanced data science techniques.

## Overview

This project analyzes over 23,000 historical football matches to build predictive models for the FIFA World Cup 2022. By combining team statistics, player performance metrics, and FIFA rankings, the model forecasts match outcomes with data-driven insights.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Dataset**: Analysis of 23,000+ historical matches
- **Rich Feature Set**: Team metrics, player ratings, FIFA rankings, and historical performance
- **Data Preprocessing**: Robust data cleaning, feature engineering, and normalization pipelines
- **Machine Learning Models**: Multiple algorithms tested for optimal prediction accuracy
- **Tournament Simulation**: Bracket predictions for the 2022 World Cup

## Dataset

The project utilizes multiple data sources including:

- Historical international football match results
- FIFA team rankings over time
- Player ratings and statistics
- Team performance metrics
- Tournament-specific data

- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and preprocessing
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
Python 3.7+
Jupyter Notebook
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AkshataJv/FIFA-World-Cup-2022-Winner-Prediction.git
cd FIFA-World-Cup-2022-Winner-Prediction
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook FIFA_World_Cup_2022_Winner.ipynb
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook `FIFA_World_Cup_2022_Winner.ipynb`
2. Run cells sequentially to:
   - Load and explore the dataset
   - Perform data preprocessing
   - Train machine learning models
   - Generate predictions for World Cup 2022 matches
   - Visualize results and insights

## Key Insights

The model considers various factors for prediction:

- **Team Strength**: Based on historical performance and FIFA rankings
- **Recent Form**: Performance in recent matches leading up to the tournament
- **Head-to-Head Records**: Historical matchups between teams
- **Player Quality**: Average player ratings and team composition
- **Tournament Context**: Stage of competition and match importance

## Results

The notebook provides:

- Model accuracy metrics and performance comparison
- Match outcome probabilities
- Tournament bracket predictions
- Feature importance analysis
- Visualization of key patterns and trends

## Limitations

- Historical data may not account for all real-world factors (injuries, tactics, etc.)
- Player form and team dynamics can change rapidly
- Unpredictable events (weather, referee decisions) are not modeled
- Past performance doesn't guarantee future results

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Integration of real-time player injury data
- [ ] Inclusion of tactical formation analysis
- [ ] Deep learning approaches (neural networks)
- [ ] Live match prediction updates
- [ ] Sentiment analysis from news and social media
- [ ] Interactive web dashboard for predictions
